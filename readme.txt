Embed media items from your MediaCore site into posts and pages

== Description ==

MediaCore's plugin allows you to embed any videos publicly accessible on your
MediaCore site.

[MediaCore](http://mediacore.com/) is an online video platform for managing,
encoding and delivering video to mobile and desktop devices.
MediaCore makes it easy for any organization to share video either publicly or
privately and build an amazing user experience on both desktop and mobile
browsers around their own content.

Who's using Mediacore? More and more MediaCore powered sites are popping up all
over the world. You can learn more about some of these sites here on our
[MediaCore showcase](http://mediacore.com/why-mediacore).
